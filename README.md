# Deep Markov Models

## Overview 

This repository contains cleaner and more modular theano code for 
implementing Deep Markov Models. 

The code is documented and should be easy to modify. 

## Requirements
This code has the following requirements:
* `python 2.7` 
* `theano`
* `theanomodels`

## Folders 
* [`model_th`](model_th/): This contains the raw theano code implementing the model.   
* [`ipynb`](ipynb/): This folder contains some IPython notebooks with examples on loading and running the model on your own data.  
* [`parse_args.py`](parse_args.py): This file contains a list of the arguments that the model takes. See the [`README.md`](model/README.md) for an explanation of 
what the various choices of parameters change in the generative model and inference network.  
* [`expt`](expt/): This folder contains the setup for running the DMM on polyphonic music.
